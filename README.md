# Portfolio

Hi, I'm Manuel and this is my Cyber Security Portfolio. Recently, I completed the CompTIA Security+ Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. The Security+ certificate has prepared me for industry-ready jobs. I am currently seeking a position that allows me to contribute to the dynamic field of cybersecurity. My ultimatw goal is to join a forward-thinking organization as a security operation center (SOC) analyst or cyber security analyst where my skills and enthusiasm for security can make a meaningful impact. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats.


Additionally, it has paved the way for me to pursue one of the entry-level following roles:

+ Cybersecurity Analyst 
+ Security Analyst
+ SOC Analyst
+ Information Security Analyst
+ IT Security Analyst
+ Cyber Defense Analyst
